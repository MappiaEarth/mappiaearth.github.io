The Slider Control is used to display a continuous or discrete range of valid numeric choices and allows the user to interact with the control. It is typically represented visually as having a "track" and a "knob" or "thumb" which is dragged within the track.

Usage: \\\{\\\{slider\|plugins=tip=Filter {0}% of total cells\|width=200px\|id=ANY_UNIQUE_ID\|value=20\|increment=5\|keyincrement=5\|minValue=0\|maxValue=100\\\}\\\}
