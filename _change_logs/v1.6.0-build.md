<b>8 Changes: 1 Highlight, 2 What's New</b>

## Highlights
- <b>fix</b>: Prevent click events on deactivated Mappia interface from propagating inside

## What's New
- <b>fix</b>: onSelectCallback now can be used with onClick correctly
    - The verification is made inside getFunction because it is always evaluated to true
- <b>fix</b>: UsabilityHelper reactivates Navigation only if it was the one that deactivated it originally.

## Under the hood
- <b>feat</b>: Navigation click and drag events should be processed last and DragPan StopDown is not necessary
- <b>fix</b>: Background Layer cannot be removed, using the group background to use as baselayers.
- <b>fix</b>: Query contents occasionally do not update.
- <b>fix</b>: Allows loading different maps as background
- <b>refactor</b>: Remove unnecessary comments and improve setQueryGlobalProperties on autocomplete.
